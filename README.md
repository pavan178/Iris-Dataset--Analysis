# Iris Dataset Analysis 📊

## 📝Introduction
This repository contains code for analyzing the Iris dataset using Python's data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 🪜Steps

### Step 1: Load the dataset
The dataset is loaded from the provided CSV file.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handle missing values by dropping them from the dataset.

### Step 3: Data Visualization
Visualize the dataset using histograms and scatter plots.

### Step 4: Data Transformation and Feature Engineering
Create a new feature called 'petal area' by multiplying petal length and width.

### Step 5: Descriptive Statistics
Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation of selected features.

### Step 6: Additional EDA Techniques (using Seaborn)
Utilize Seaborn library for additional exploratory data analysis techniques such as box plots and correlation matrices.
